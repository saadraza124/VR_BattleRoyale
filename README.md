# VR_BattleRoyale(incomplete)

A battle royale multiplayer game with VR experience.
i started this project as my final year project seeing the growth of battle royale genre but could carry on with it due to some university limitations.

**Idea:**
a multiplayer vr game where user will move the character through portals, shoots and launch(throw) objects at opponents.
Last one standing wins.

**Progress:**
character's movement, shooting, launching is complete.
VR environment with a basic stage map is complete.
Multiplayer and syncing is incomplete.
UI/UX is incomplete.
